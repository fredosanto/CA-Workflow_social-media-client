# GitHub Pages

I messed up my pages deployment and didn't manage to recover it, so my delivery is supposed to have an additional. When I try to configure new static html or 'create your own' it won't appear in 'Actions'. 'Build and deployement' 'source' settings is put on GitHub Actions, but still nothing.
